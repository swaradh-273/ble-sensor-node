# BLE Sensor Node – ESP32-C3 + BME280

## 🧠 Overview
This project simulates a low-power BLE sensor node using the ESP32-C3 and BME280 environmental sensor. The node is designed for wireless data transmission over BLE, with onboard voltage regulation and I²C communication between components.

## Hardware Design

- MCU: ESP32-C3
- Sensor: BME280 (I²C)
- Power Supply: Onboard 3.3V regulation
- Communication: BLE + I²C
- PCB: 2-layer custom PCB designed in EasyEDA
